Hey my name is **Mihailo Kalinic**, I'm glad you wondered over to see really who I am. Currently I'm 19 and a university student at UTS (University of Technology Sydney) and am undertaking the Bachelor of Computing Science (Honours) course where I'm now beginning my 3rd year.

Apart from enjoying everything tech during my free time I enjoy playing and watching sports as well as gaming both of which brings out my ~~very~~ **EXTREMELY** competitive nature. As my sports hobby I'm really into basketball, having played representative basketball in my junior years I have now moved and currently still play in the Bankstown Basketball local competition in Men's.

# Career Plan
> #### What have I achieved so far

In terms of a career I have unfortunately yet to secure any position within IT. Whilst I haven't had a job in IT I have had quite a few intern IT interviews for helpdesk type positions.

> ### What are my Strengths

Personally I believe that I’m a great communicator with other people, and can interact with people very easily. Another one of my strengths is that I’m very hardworking and determined, as I always make sure to put all my effort to complete any task given to me to the best of my ability.  Lastly I believe that another great strength of mine is having the capacity to learn very quickly.

> ###  What are my career intentions

Currently as I haven't had any career in IT I would like to start in an intern position at a base IT level to hone in my fundamental skills needed to progress my career further down the track. From there I would like to join a SOC (Security Operations Centre) team, where I believe is the best place to progress too and start a career in cybersecurity. Between progressing in my career I would also like to gain certification so I can validate to my employers that I have the skills necessary within IT.

# My Motivation

> #### Why did I choose the studio

I choose to take a dive into the Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset studio because I wanted to get a taste of what cybersecurity really entails. Currently I’ve had very little experience within cybersecurity but have really enjoyed learning about cryptography. This has led me wanting to learn more about cybersecurity and I really believe that this studio is the way to go in increasing my knowledge in cybersecurity especially now that it is such a growing sector within information technology.

Another contributing factor as to why I’ve chosen to undertake the studio is because of the interaction with industry professionals. With this studio, I thought it would be a great way to allow me to understand the cybersecurity industry within Australia, and additionally network with industry professionals.

> #### What do I want to be bale to do at the end of the studio?

Firstly I would like to broaden my horizons of what cyber security has to offer and understand the various different branches of careers cybersecurity has to offer within Australia. Added with this I would also like to understand how the industry interprets cybersecurity threats and start thinking from the business perspective of how threats should be handled most effectively.

Secondly, I would really like to have the ability to start thinking (problem solving) like a hacker, so that I can be apart of the preventative measures that stop cyber attacks. Added to thinking like a hacker I believe this would entail us to take part in some pen testing attacks to really learn how attacks happen and understand the various attack vectors employed for a successful attack.  

Lastly I would possibly like if I could increase my chances of getting a starting career position within IT (specifically cybersecurity), by undertaking the studio.
