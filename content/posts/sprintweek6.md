## *SLO 1)*
> ### Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.


One of the main focuses this week was on the final roadshow presentation for the studio. Within the roadshow I was able to interact with a wide variety of individuals whilst presenting where many had varying levels of knowledge within IT and the cyber security industry as a whole.

Whilst presenting to more technical inclined stakeholders (former class teachers, IT students, etc) alike, I found that many understood how the vulnerabilities I presented in the roadshow occur and lead to attacks. One main such example was with un-updated services which within the industry allowed for the formation of high level risks to these services as vulnerabilities and exploits had already been formulated and prepared for executing attacks. Moreover whilst presenting to the more technical stakeholders most brought about the concepts of misconfigurations and how ultimately errors by internal users of systems also caused varying issues within services that could be exploited by attackers. As such interacting with more technical stakeholders allowed me to encapsulate, that issues presented within the presentations are also very applicable exploits faced within the general scope of real world cyber attacks used.

Moreso within the roadshow I also had the opportunity to present to audiences with no technical knowledge of the cyber security industry. Whilst presenting the demonstration many were intrigued by the drastic impacts a simple outdated service/application has upon a system. Additionally whilst showing misconfigurations within the demonstration that ended revealing a unhashed password that had subsequently been reused by the user, I found it interesting how many people had generally admitted to re-using the same passwords for a wide variety of services (possibly all :/ ). From these interactions I was able to gather that general users within systems also posed as security risks due to their practices and that security teams also have to look over a user's actions as their misunderstanding could also pose as a security vulnerability to services and applications. Down below is an image of my group captured during one of my roadshow presentations;

Within this week I was able to personally engage with many individuals who had differing perceptions and knowledge levels about the cyber security industry. With gathering all these varying perceptions individuals have about the industry I was able to understand how professionals have to deal with varying individuals whilst explaining security concepts to clients of differing technical abilities.

## *SLO 2)*

> ### Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.

This week we were instructed to complete an individual Hack The Box machine that we hadn’t previously completed. Personally I choose to go with Traverxec as did much of the class as it was the next progression in machines suggested by Studio Mentor Jason. As such many problems I’ve faced this week stemmed from the deliverable but additionally the roadshow presentation I also had.

Like other week one of the main problems was my lack of understanding with certain concepts contained within my deliverable. This week it was more specifically to do with not understanding how a specific HTTP server really worked (please refer to my write up for further details on this). But by researching online documentation, using the manual pages of the service and also a collaboration amongst my peers and with my studio mentor I was able to effectively overcome these issues and have a better grasp of the concepts that pertained to the box in general. Down below is an image of Jason explaining the HTTP server concept;

Additionally whilst completing this box I realized that I never really knew how to unzip files on a UNIX command line interface, with research into implementing commands through manual pages and through watching practical demonstrations on youtube I was able to figure how to gain access to the certain files I needed to progress through.

As such we also were tasked with the roadshow presentation this week, where my team an I had to make sure to cater to people's different knowledge levels (spoken in SLO1), but additionally had to make sure that the presentation was designed in such a way to keep audiences attention and make sure to engage with individuals throughout the presentation to make sure they are interested as within presentation individuals lose concentration within the first 30 seconds and we had to make sure that interest was kept high through engagement and explanation of process and task we were doing.

## *SLO 3)*

> ### Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.

My technical skills this week were mostly contained within the deliverable activity where I managed to gain full system access with a root users shell. As such the write-up/documentation below contains and portrays the technical abilities I’ve implemented and new skills gained through completing the tasks at hand;

** [Week 6 Deliverable]() **


As I’ve applied in previous weeks, this week I’ve ultimately made sure to consider the penetration testing cycle/methodology into my attack vectors when completing my deliverable so I can further mimic attack designs that are used within the professional industry. Also I’ve continued watching through IppSec going through retired Hack The Box machines so that I can learn more practically how tools I possibly haven’t used before are implemented and also process through the technical skills he uses so I can emulate them..

> ### Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

This week effective collaboration and communication was an essential aspect in completing all tasks of the roadshow presentation and also deliverable content as time restrictions (with the subject ending) really started to kick in.

With the roadshow presentation teams already formed this week we effectively started concentrating on the presentation. Working with 3 other individuals we used differing communication channels of; facebook messenger and discord to collaboratively give personal inputs to certain ideas and also solved any issues we had simultaneously through this. Moreover we also set up a google slides for the presentation to work on the slideshow that would be our final presentation concept ;

Further we also arranged to come in as a group on Wednesday in which we practiced our presentations, this allowed us to see our weakness and allow us to improve with more practice. Also studio mentor Jason observed our presentation and gave us feedback and made my group and I really rethink our presentation and structure in such a way that it becomes more appealing to audiences. With this collaboration and communication with each other and with mentor Jason we effectively made sure we had a presentation that would last us throughout the roadshow event.

The final standup meeting of the studio was also another avenue where my communication and collaboration skills played a factor within the studio as effectively communicating my strength, weaknesses and goals had allowed me to reflect on the tasks that I needed to complete being; the deliverable box and presentation, and really evaluate my trajectory and see if I'm going in the correct direction.

> ### Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation.

Reflecting upon the final week of the studio, I feel as if personally it has been an enriching experience but also a very time consuming week with all the content wrapping up, but in the end I managed to stay on path and complete all the tasks that were expected by the studio facilitators. Personally I also feel as if my technical skills have been furthered this week with working through my deliverable task of the Traverxec box, down below is an image from Hack The Box showing that I got the correct root.txt and completed the box fully.

Evaluating my performance this week, I found that it was easy for me to complete tasks at hand as throughout the roadshow my team was very good at communicating which allowed us all to complete our work. And also with my deliverable I found that throughout the weeks I’ve gained the skills necessary to complete the task much quicker as enumerating became much easier for me as I being to become more accustomed to the tools used within penetration testing. Whilst all tasks were completed in due time I found that this week procrastination started to kick in and that towards the later half of the week I slowed down my progress. This really affected me as though all studio content was completed, I didn’t progress on too much on extra curricular content specific to the Security+, which is something that I want to complete and have been encouraged by the studio to complete to continue my studies to improve my cyber security knowledge.

Within the studio my peers have also been a great helping hand within this final week. This is really evident as many peer members have helped with content/tools needed to complete my deliverable by pointing me in the right direction with which documentation to read upon to help speed the process as there was a lot of content due this week.

Though heavily mentioned previously (in SLO 4) my group members this week have been absolutely amazing with completing and collaborating with content and all have done work assigned, and performance wise were all on target.
