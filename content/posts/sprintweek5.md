## *SLO 1)*
> ### Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.

This week we had two guest speakers; Nathan Jones and Pieter Westein from consultancy firm ‘Deloitte’ come into the studio and present to us their experiences within cyber security, currently both work in the cyber attack and response team. After introductories (about pen testing) they started to give a short description of their roles and it was great to see that even though they actively attack systems they also have to provide a succinct report of the methodologies used to attack systems. This allows organisations to plan defensive mechanisms to prepare for possible attacks that could have taken place of the same nature that a hired penetration testing team implemented and negate the chances of catastrophic damages upon an organisations IT systems. As such I now understand why for the last few weeks we have been instructed by studio mentors to keep doing write ups of the methodologies we used for hacking certain boxes, as it will prepare us for the reporting phase that both Pieter and Nathan have to do daily within their careers.

They then proceeded to explain the structure (cycle) of a penetration test, and ended up explaining each process step in depth which I really though was informative and insightful as last week I had strategised to focus on the penetration testing cycle to encapsulate the mindset of an attacker. It was great to see that this was also a focus taken upon by industry professionals when completing a penetration test.  

Next the speakers spoke of their role as much more of a ‘red team’ operation and presented upon how there were many concepts involved with performing an attack against and organisation, as shown below;

What was intriguing to me was that cybersecurity teams have a ‘physical’ aspect to undertake, as before this studio I thought that all attacks were remote (on PC away from an organisations building). As such it was really interesting to see that there were many factors involved in and attack upon an organisation.

This week's interaction with the two external stakeholders really helped me understand how cybersecurity professions really operate within the industry and gave me insight into the very broad range of procedures that needed to be undertaken to execute an attack. Moreover they presented a range of problems they faced within the industry, one such example being that some organisation that requested penetration testing ignored the test and planned system maintenance whilst penetration test was occuring, which inevitably caused errors within the system, and this was one of many issues that they had to deal with.

## *SLO 2)*

> ### Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.

Similar to the previous weeks, this week we were tasked with completing a deliverable individually of gaining access to user.txt on any system within Hack The Box. I chose to do Open Admin as according to Jason (studio mentor) this was an entry level box and moreover this was going to be the first box with no specific hints or write ups available online for the box.

To gain access to the Hack The Box we first needed to gain an invite code which was hidden within the website. Personally what was holding me back from gaining the invite code was a lack of knowledge and understanding of how to use the chrome development tools on browser and also not understanding javascript and how a beautifier works. From watching through various online tutorials and also communicating with the classroom I was guided to content that will help me understand and through this I was able to overcome my first issue and finally gain access to the invite code.

As such this week's issues were mostly within the deliverable task of using OpenAdmin. The main issue stemmed around my lack of knowledge with understanding how the SSH protocol worked. Such an example was with needing to use the SSH protocol with keys for authentication, personally I had never known how the SSH protocol worked, i just knew what it did and upon being tasked with the challenge never really cared as to how it worked. Through researching online, using the manual pages of SSH and talking to studio mentor Jason, I was able to understand the protocol to a much higher level which allowed me to deal with implementing SSH in my machine. Moreover there were other concepts I didn't really understand but Jason helped me by guiding me to resources that would assist me, as shown below GTFOBins which is a list on unix binaries that could be exploited, personally I didn’t know such page existed and upon being on the page it allowed me to exploit the system and hadn’t it been for the online resource I would not be able to overcome the problem and eventually gain root.

## *SLO 3)*

> ### Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.

This week most of my time was spent on the deliverable activity, where I ended up become ‘root user’ on the system, the write up down below contains all each step I’ve taken to completing the task and shows all technical tools and concepts I’ve used for completing the deliverable;

** [Week 5 Deliverable](https://mikik.me/posts/devliverableweek5/) **

Throughout this week and as mentioned last week, I tried to really implement the penetration testing cycle into my attack methodology so that I could more realistically simulate how a ‘real world’ penetration tester would think. Personally I believe that I did very well with the discovery/enumerating phase as I would relentlessly not stop uncovering as much information as I could, but I still need to develop upon technical skill within the exploitation phase as this is where I feel very weak.

Additionally to further develop upon my technical skills I’ve started watching IppSec videos of retired boxes on the Hack The Box service to really understand how he develops his thinking for attacking certain boxes and moreover the technical skills he uses when implementing these attacks.

> ### Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

This week personally I felt as if collaboration and communication within the studio was a huge aspect in assisting for the completion of my deliverable task.

Within this week I spent a lot of time communicating with studio mentor Jason on the specific contents of my box Open Admin. Via communicating with him with issues I seemed to be having he assisted with concepts and really helped me understand by interactively engaging with me to think and lead me down the right track. Such example can be seen down below, when Jason was helping me understand a concept that I was having trouble understanding.

I also had one of my peers within the studio named David help me in the beginning fazes of completing the box as I seemed to be going down the wrong path. He helped hint me towards the correct direction, such image of our chat log can been seen down below, where collaborating with him allowed me to progress quicker in the box;

Similar to all previous weeks we also had our stand up meetings, in this week's talk to the class I felt as if I gained much more confidence with my strengths and this communication with class members really allowed me to reflect on the experience thus far and showed me how far I’ve progressed with my skills and also with communicating to other for help with content. Also coming in on the Wednesday help session (even though VPN services were terrible) really helped me brainstorm my next points of emphasis in my box as I was able to interact with other studio members and talk to them about their current struggles, with the box.

# *SLO 5)*

> ### Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation.

Upon reflection this week has certainly been rewarding and beneficial as all tasks/goals I set out at the start of the week were completed. As such performance wise for me personally was going great as this week I has set myself a much more flexible and robust timetable that allowed for daily inconveniences to not tamper with other activities I had planned and hence allowed me to have such a strong performing week in terms of efficiency. This was great as last week I felt that my time management was a main issue that really held me back. Though one issue I had that could be improved upon was my write up, as I didn’t keep my progress of my box up to date I found myself forgetting tools I used and moreover it ended up taking a lot of time, that could have been used doing other things, over the next coming week I want to improve this and complete my write up simultaneously. But however I did manage to complete the open admin box and am very proud of this, such image of mu complete can be seen in the image below;

Moreover I also feel as if I need to be less stressed when undertaking activities/tasks, as noted with both my studio mentors in our mandatory one on one meeting, was that I had not become very easily frustrated when I could not complete a task. Personally I will try to improve on this over the coming week by allowing myself time to relax and reassuring myself that I will eventually figure out an answer to the issue I may be dealing with.

The peers alongside me in this studio have been great just like in all previous weeks. I am finding that it is becoming very easy to communicate with my peers when requiring assistance with issues I might be having with a task. Additionally many of my peers also come to the drop in session hosted on Wednesday and we all seem to work in a nice atmosphere where learning and collaboration are key.

To conclude my goal for next week is to set another great timetable as I did this week to allow me to be as consistent and efficient as I’ve been. I will work on doing my write up, whilst completing my work so I don’t forget concepts I’ve used and will also try to be calm about the whole process and relax much more when completing work.
