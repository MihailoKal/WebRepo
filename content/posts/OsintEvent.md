# OSINT
Over the second week at university, I had the pleasure to present to the UTS Cyber Security Society (CSEC), at the first introductory event as a committee member. My presentation was based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), where I went over; the basics, discussed the reasons for OSINT within cyber, OSINT's implementations in industry and lastly presented the OSINT framework in my explanation about OSINT. 

After completing the explanatory section of the presentation I went on to present the OSINT challenge I made (available for viewing on UTS: CSEC slack upon membership).

# Reflection
Upon reflecting on the event I felt that it was a great experience, in that I was able to explain concepts which felt like such a rewarding experience in itself. Additionally being able to build on my public speaking and communicating with the whole executive team on my presentation and details within also added to the experience and made me understand the effort which is put into a presentation from timing to engagement levels.
