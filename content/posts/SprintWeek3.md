## *SLO 1)*
> ### Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.

Within this week's studio external stakeholders did not come to present to us at university. As such we were encouraged by studio mentors to attend external cybersecurity talks to engage with stakeholders and furthermore hopefully network. This was the SecTalks event hosted at the PwC building in Barangaroo, though unfortunately I couldn’t attend this event as I didn't RSVP on time. From research and communicating with a peer who had attended the studio I’ve come to realise that this was an informative event that will help anyone within the cybersecurity industry expand their perspectives. Not only for next week but for the future I will really try to attend these meetups due to their many benefits.

Alas no external stakeholders were present though I still had the studio facilitators who helped me in retrospect. This mainly had to do with guiding me through this week's content gap which I experienced and moreover also assisted me with career opportunities within the industry. Specifically Max who helped me with my resume by giving me tips and more so showing me to tailor my cover letters towards the requirements of the given opportunity.

## *SLO 2)*

> ### Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.


This week was similar to last week in which we were instructed to complete a deliverable task, this week it was on a web exploit. Moreover we were also given the opportunity to test out different types of web vulnerabilities one created instances of an “OWASP Juice Shop’.

But unfortunately at first I didn't even know which web vulnerability was the most common and additionally didn't know how to use any of the exploits. As such I went through hackspalining and created notes as seen: (ADD PDF), moreover I made significant progress learning about common vulnerabilities. (ADD IMAGE of hacksplaining progress)

Throughout the week I also had issues with understanding the content for my deliverable (LFI), as I didn’t understand a few vital components that were needed to know how LFI works. So I had started researching online about HTTP request methods, how directory transversal works, understand /etc/passwd file (and etc/shadow) and also understanding how legacy LAMP hosting websites work. All this was done through a variety of ways including ‘youtubing’, searching documentation, using online learning tools (i.e. portswigger and hacksplaining) and using forums discussing the content, all the following issues were dealt with. Another issue I had encountered was within the deliverable was not understanding how to use a tool to show the attack (burp suite), lucky my peer helped me understand how the proxy work with burp suites and allows us to intercept packets and inspect elements of the HTTP headers to gain valuable information to use the LFI attack against a vulnerable website (we used the tryhackme LFI challenge website given as our vulnerabile website).

add my natas progression and how i used LFI in level 7
talk about my sec+

# *SLO 4)*

> ### Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

As previously mentioned this week we were tasked with a deliverable which was a group presentation on a web exploit or vulnerability. My group chose LFI (Local File Inclusion) as our web vulnerability. As discussed in class the presentation was to portray four main content points mines were; what was the attack and the impact of the attack.Though the work was complete it felt rushed and was left till the night before the presentation as evident through the chat logs

To edit content we used Google Docs and Google slides, it allowed us to see where each member was up to in their progression for completing their parts. Moreover it allowed for proof checking and also edits by other members if content was deemed irrelevant. For communication between team members I had created a private Microsoft Teams channel with my other two peers to allow for easy and efficient communication.   

On presentation day one group member had unfortunately fallen sick, as such I took it upon myself to take over his part which was a demonstration of the attack. Luckily enough a pre-recorded YouTube video was made by the group member and the day before he had also explained the content so presenting his part whilst daunthing by not having a speech to go off was ultimately a great learning experience.  

Additionally, throughout both studio lessons we had our stand-up meetings, through communicating with others and presenting my own stand-up, I could generally see that time management was an issue for all group members who were attempting to learn more content outside university hours. Their strategies for overcoming these issues (planning time out) allowed me to reconsider and this week I have also made my own plan to follow through and make sure that I complete and learn all content I would like throughout the week whilst not at university.
