# Introduction
With the Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset Summer Studio coming to a close I for one can say that it has been an experience I will cherish for the rest of my university years. Before commencing the summer studio I had a very novice level of understanding of any concept within cybersecurity, to the extent of not even knowing what a reconnaissance tool was. Moreover, my general IT knowledge was very ‘rusty’, but as the weeks went on and the summer studio progressed I found that my understanding of concepts had advanced to a much higher level. This is most notably seen with my progression in being able to complete an individual machine on Hack The Box services (which have recruiters on it) and be able to document the technical skills I used to complete to task, all that added with the fact that all technical skills I’ve used, through implementing tools and design attack methodologies, were all concepts that were foreign to me before the beginning of the studio. This progression of my technical abilities I’ve developed throughout the studio have made me satisfied with my knowledge within cyber security now.

Even though I put in A LOT of work to achieve what I have in the studio, I would also like to give a special thanks to all three of my studio mentors; Jason, Larry and Max for helping me along this journey and guiding me through the studio to make it successful as it has been. Their organisation and preparation have been a great attribute and have really allowed me to expand my horizons as an individual within the IT security world. Down below is my final reflection of the which synthesises my learning journey throughout the studio, with accordance to the five learning objectives.

# Reflection

## *SLO 1)*
> ### Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.


Within the studio we had ample amounts of opportunity to interact with differing stakeholders throughout the cyber security industry, and from these opportunities we got to hear their perspectives on certain problems. With each stakeholder that came in and presented their chosen topics within the IT industry, I was able to formulate my own ideologies of current issues that were faced within the cyber landscape. The external stakeholders who engaged with the studio throughout the six weeks were;
+ Week 1: Matthew Brennan (Indue) (Security Analyst): Gave me an understanding of how businesses operate with the cyber security industry, and how issues arise within organizations through their perceptions of cyber threats and issues.
+ Week 2 : Patrick Kelso (UTS) (Cloud Enablement Lead): Presented a practical tutorial on how he worked with the Linux CLI and really portrayed the importance of mastering CLI skills for a future within cybersecurity.
+ Week 2 : Robert Mitchell (GitLab) (Security Engineer Manager): Introduced general IT security concepts and gave a glimpse into how attacks have shifted throughout the years. He honed in on the concept that understanding a system was integral to know how to attack it
+ Week 5: Nathan Jones & Pieter Westein (Deloitte) (Penetration Testing Team): Took us through how a penetration test is formulated and the methodology of a penetration test and then illuminated how their roles were within the industry and gave us certain problems they’ve faced in their jobs.

Additionally I've also engaged with my studio facilitators numerous times, as sometimes I felt I didn't understand some concepts and they are there to push me towards the right direction in understanding. Once I had encapsulated a solution and had presented to studio mentor I understood it, this really allowed me to remember the concepts and also fathom how the attack methodology could be used as a real world application in an attack and form as an issue with cyberspace.

## *SLO 2)*

> ### Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.

Applying a process of designed and system thinking were a crucial component within the studio as each week I was expected to complete a differing task assigned by the studio facilitators. These tasks included challenges and deliverable components that all differed to each other and required differing concepts of knowledge needed to complete these tasks, and it was ultimately required that I implement a critical process to surpass the issue I had with the tasks within.

As such when problems did arise within the studio task content, I made sure to always apply research techniques to better understand some of the concepts involved with the problem. Much of this research included going through official releases of documentation then making sure to check if possible that the manual pages existed and then reading through them. And then lastly having a live demonstration of the concept being explained through youtube videos, which all really helped me encapsulate how something worked to a deeper level and generally allowed me to understand how the concept worked. I found myself applying this research technique throughout the studio and found that it helped me better understand concepts and allowed me to solve some issues I had. The best example of this had to be during my week 2 deliverable group presentation on a reconsiaainse tool gobuster where i had no idea how it worked but going through the documentation on Kali for gobuster introduced the tool and then reading the help flag when using gobuster -h on the CLI helped me understand optional flags that could be implemented and the ultimately watching a youtube video on the tool really understand all the flag (including the wordlist) needed to use the tool.

Additionally I also had a low level of knowledge within cybersecurity and felt that also caused many of my problems to arise, to counter this I decided to design some extra materials online to help me fill in the gaps to catch up to all my classmates.  [Here are](/HANotes.pdf) some notes I personally complied to through hacksplaining to help me understand these extra security concepts so that less problems arose due to my lack of knowledge.



*****************
## *SLO 3)*

> ### Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.

Within the six weeks of the studio, each week required me to apply technical skills through completing the deliverable content that was assigned to us by studio mentors. As such the technical skills I’ve since learnt from the beginning of the studio are immense and throughout the weeks I have been able to systematically apply these skills effectively with the deliverable tasks that needed to be completed. Down below I’ve compiled a list of the technical skills I’ve used each week;

+ **Week One**: Within this week I created my first static site which will act as my template for the rest of the studio and possibly my future career within cybersecurity. Whilst creating live site I had to apply my skills with git (Version Control System), using and implementing Markdown, and understanding how the live website works with netfliy pointing to my github repository. Additionally, I also set up my Kali Linux as a Virtual Machine on my computer.
+ **Week Two**: This week I learned about how reconnaissance tools worked and a variety of differing tools, as such my deliverable was on gobuster, and I was able to test my skills with the tool later on DVWA. I additionally went on Over The Wire to apply some of my technical skills with Linux (using Bandit), and also played around with web app attacks (NATAS)
+ **Week Three**: Went into detail about how website applications worked and also the common exploits and vulnerabilities that existed (examples include; SQLI, XSS, File Upload Vulnerabilities, directory transversal, etc), and tried to implement these with OWASP Juice Shop. My deliverable was on Local File Inclusion and I practiced on the Try Hack Me services that had a box just for LFI.  I continued going over NATAS to apply some more technical skills I have gained with my increased knowledge of web app exploits and progressed further in the levels [write up avaiable here](/NatasWriteUp.pdf). Also set up and figured out how to use some items within BurpSuite.
+ **Week Four**: I started to complete some CTF challenges on the Try Hack Me and vulnhub, which allowed me to use all the technical skills I had developed as a whole and combine all content I had studied so far. I ended completing Basic Pentesting 1 form vulnhub and with Try Hack Me I completed vulnversity (box which allowed me to apply tool skills technically) and also Mr Robot CTF, [Write up here](https://mikik.me/posts/deliverableweek4/)
+ **Week Five**: Started applying my skills on Hack The Box service, first with gaining an invite code and then with completing my first box Open Admin.[Write up here](https://mikik.me/openAdmin.pdf) . As such with Hack The Box I applied all the technical skills i had gained but had also learnt new technical concepts and skills, and resources to apply more technical skills to have more of an impact as an attack.
+ **Week Six**: Keep using Hack The Box, and completed my last box of traverxec [Write up here](https://mikik.me/Traverxec-Write-Up.pdf), which became easier and also found similarities with attack vectors used as openAdmin.

Additionally towards the last few weeks I’ve also really tried to implement the penetration testing methodology/cycle when completing my work, as personally i believe this skill will allow me to be a better attacker and will allow me to progress within the IT Security industry.



*****************
# *SLO 4)*

> ### Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

Personally I believe that my collaboration and communication skills were what really helped me progress within the studio, as I had no prior experience within cyber security I leveraged my great communicative abilities to make sure that when I needed assistance I was helped with the content so that I could keep progressing through.There were three deliverables which required group work and within each of these situations I believe that I was a great team player for contributing to content and also able to facilitate each member when errors arose within. As such this also extended to doing individual activities where fellow peers would assist me and I assist others with helping lead them in the right direction, with certain errors they would be possibly facing. I attribute this to my peers all being focused as a group on completing a somewhat coherent common goal in this learning journey we have been through in the summer studio.

I believe that the standup meetings also served as a great avenue for implementing collaborative and communicative skills. As participating in these really allowed me to gain an understanding of where I am compared with the class pace, and made sure I didn’t fall being but also evaluate if I was on target as communicating my goals to an audience really makes me want to go through and achieve my goals.

Additionally the non face to face hours (Wednesday and late Monday & Thursday) within the studio is where I believe communication and collaboration is really advanced as each individual is there to complete work and I find that whilst completing work, many ended up being stuck on the same content and could effectively help each other towards reaching the same solution.


*****************
# *SLO 5)*

> ### Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation.

With the studio each week were offered the opportunity to effectively self evaluate upon our completion of content within the studio through the weekly reflections that needed to be submitted in each sprint. These reflections really served to keep my mind with the goals I had set out and in a way made me commit to the goals as I had already spoken about focusing myself to complete them. Additional to the self criticisms we complied, we also had feedback given by our tutors to balance out the personal self criticisms and see which personal reflections were perceived by others to be justified. Personally I never had too much inconsistency from my reflection to what my tutors spoke to me about and I felt as if i was criticising myself in proper due accordance.

As such conducting these self reviews through the studio, has allowed me to now see how much I have grown as the studio has progressed. This is best seen with my technical abilities I have acquired from the studio with now being able to complete boxes on Hack The Box from where I began as a novice in the field.  I also feel as if my character has grown as well, because of all the struggles I’ve had with understanding the content within the studio but managing to complete all tasks really brought out the resilience in me. With this in mind i can personally say that I more than pleased with the how the studio has turned out for me and I believe it has been a subject that I will still refer back to for content in my near future.

My group and peers were also critical within the studio experience I’ve had as the team comradery we all have built up over the progression of the weeks, throughout having to complete tasks that challenged us we exceeded all as a team in communicating this to each other and also portraying it to our studio mentors.

Lastly I also believe that I have had a great performance with the studio and that I have achieved most of the things I've set out for myself, and this is evident throughout the reflections I’ve submitted where I communicated that my performance most weeks was efficient as possible.

# Conclusion

I started out this subject as a pure novice but really believe I have expanded with my technical and personal abilities by attending this studio. As such to start the studio I had developed a list of goals they were;
+ Gain practical hacking experience
+ Interact with industry professionals
+ Gain the mindset of a hacker,
+ Possibly land a position within IT

The process of encapsulating and learning throughout the studio has been a very rewarding experience for me personally . As such from my knowledge standpoint I believe that I have gained a practical side into hacking by undertaking this studio as it concentration on this element through using Hack THe Box Machines, I now feel as if I have some experience with hacking and can now somewhat understand some methodologies used in very big cyber attacks.

Additionally I’ve also found that this was a great studio to interact with industry professionals (as seen in SLO1), we had a bunch of external industry expertise come and give advice for us in the studio. As such I’ve taken aboard some of this advice and have chosen to really leverage this knowledge in the future when needed. As such I also feel as if I’ve made a massive progression towards having the mindset of a hacker, as through studying the penetration testing cycle I can implement attacks that industry penetration testers use.

Finally with landing a possible IT position, come to the end of this studio I unfortunately have not achieved any role yet within the industry. But through the studio I’ve made strides on achieving this as I’ve gained many new connections on LinkedIn, been able to further my resume with adding content I’ve learnt within the studio and also having mentored feedback by professors for applying for certain positions and then reviewing my resume/s. Moreover completing this studio has given me the confidence to apply for more roles as now I can say that I can possibly fit under the category of an Intern/Junior Security Analyst.
