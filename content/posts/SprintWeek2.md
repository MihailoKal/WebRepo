## *SLO 1) EDIT THIS ONE*
> ### Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.
This week we were privileged to receive two speakers; Patrick Kelso and Rob Mitchell who both had a great wealth of knowledge within the IT domain and came to present in the studio.

First to speak was Patrick Kelso, who currently works as the cloud enablement lead at UTS. His talk was more practical with a live demonstration on the Linux CLI, watching Kelso use the Linux CLI with i3 (tiling window manager) and running commands through to a virtual private server (using digital ocean) was very inspiring. He recommended the whole studio to use Manjaro which is a beginner friendly distro (based on Arch Linux), as our main Operating System, and that the best way to learn Linux is by using it. Kelso also mentioned how in other roles he had for major companies, all had Linux servers running.

Hence learning how to master Linux will prove to be a major advantage career wise for employment within the IT industry. Not to mention how important skills within linux are essential for a career in cybersecurity. His talk really had me consider switching to make my main OS just a Linux distro and not use Windows anymore.

The second speaker Rob Mitchell who is a Security Engineer Manager at Gitlab spoke from an IT security perspective. He started by introducing a historical timeline on internet threats through 5 generations. With this talk it became apparent that even though IT has progressed so far, simple attacks from older generations still cause havoc in today's world. These attacks also include social engineered attacks, such an example would be an email/text message being sent to impose an organisation or person asking for confidential credentials to gain access to systems as that particular user.

> ### Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.

This weeks studio was same like last week as the content being presented was all new to me. On Tuesday I got introduced to what the pentesting methodology was and on a basic level how it works as an informative loop to attack systems. Additionally I received a deliverable group presentation project based on a ‘reconnaissance tool’, a term which before this week I had no idea about, in a cybersecurity context. As such our group was suggested to use gobuster as our reconnaissance tool, and through studying the github documentation of gobuster, I was surprised how many flags could be implemented to get desired output depending on what mode used.

One important concept I learnt through the gobuster documentation was what a wordlist was, as to use gobsuter a wordlist had to specified to brute force against the specified target URL.  

Another issue I had was that I didn’t know what website to use gobuster against and reading the ethical hacking disclaimer from the presentation slides I choose instead of using it against a website to go and watch youtube demonstrations on how the tool is implemented. From these videos and also using the documentation online I was able to understand both how the tool works and also understand the information gathering stage in the pentesting methodology.

Down below is an image of one the youtube videos I used to help me fully understand gobuster.

## *SLO 3)*

> ### Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.

Throughout this week we were given the opportunity to go through wargames, I choose to go and do Bandit as the linux commands I know are basic and I haven't had much experience with Linux to where I feel comfortable. The first few levels were all simple and weren't very difficult as I had used all the commands before, progressing through the levels I hadn't used some commands, such as; file, find, uniq and strings. The manual pages were very helpful in allowing me to understand how these commands work, and moreover youtube videos also helped to assist me in understanding how these commands work through demonstrated examples. To pass each level you would have to uncover the password, and I chose to store every password in a text file, and additionally included a little hint of how I completed the level. This can be seen in the image below;

# *SLO 4)*

> ### Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

As discussed above, this week included a deliverable group presentation about a reconnaissance tool of the groups choice and we selected gobsuter as suggested by one of the studio mentors. We choose to use Microsoft Teams to communicate to each other as a group so we created a new channel consisting of all four group members,

As displayed above this allowed us to communicate with each other through messages and moreover allowed us to add our own files and edit files simultaneously. Moreover we compiled a wiki where we put all relevant links to what documentation and videos were useful to understanding how gobuster works.

> ### Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation.
