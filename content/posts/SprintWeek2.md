## *SLO 1)*
> ### Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.

This week we were privileged to receive two speakers; Patrick Kelso and Rob Mitchell who both had a great wealth of knowledge within the IT domain and came to present in the studio.

First to speak was Patrick Kelso, who currently works as the Cloud Enablement Lead at UTS. His talk was more practical with a live demonstration on the Linux CLI, watching Kelso use the Linux CLI with i3 (tiling window manager) and running everything through his virtual private server (using digital ocean) was very inspiring and informative. He recommended the whole studio to use Manjaro which is a beginner friendly distribution (based on Arch Linux), as our main Operating System, and that the best way to learn Linux is by using it. Kelso also mentioned how in other roles he has had for major companies (i.e Deloitte), all of the companies had a Linux distribution running there servers.

Hence learning how to master Linux will prove to be a major advantage career wise for employment within the IT industry. Not to mention how important skills within the linux CLI are essential for a career in cybersecurity. His talk really had me consider switching to make my main OS just as a Linux distribution and not use Windows anymore. But for now I will implement a dual boot and instead of using Ubuntu as I earlier planned I will now use Manjaro.

The second speaker Rob Mitchell who is a Security Engineer Manager at Gitlab spoke from an IT security perspective. He started by introducing a historical timeline on internet threats through 5 generations. With this talk it became apparent that even though IT has progressed so far, simple attacks from older generations (i.e viruses) still cause havoc in today's world. These attacks also include social engineered attacks which have in effect been a common attack theme throughout all 5 generations, such an example would be an email/text message being sent to impose an organisation or person asking for confidential credentials to gain access to systems as that particular user.

Mitchell progressed to talk how the cybersecurity industry is, he honed in that understanding a system was much more important than understanding the product and gave us a famous phone phreaking example that occurred in the 1960’s with AT&T that showed how understanding the system allowed the attacker to make free calls. This resonated with me as understanding the underlying principles and fundamentals will make me a much better attacker. He also talked about how learning to code was important as automating is bringing all teams within IT together. I personally had the chance to ask Mitchell on his thought about starting in a low level IT role to gain experience and progress to cybersecurity to which he absolutely agreed and said that some of the best engineers he knew all started in helpdesk type roles.

To conclude both speakers who came in presented invaluable information that changed my perspective in regards to using Linux (Kelso) and the cybersecurity industry (Mitchell). These viewpoints will hopefully allow me to better learn content and possibly better prepare for a career within IT.

## *SLO 2)*

> ### Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.

This weeks studio was same like last week as the content being presented was all new to me. On Tuesday I got introduced to what the pentesting methodology was and on a basic level how it works as an informative loop to attack systems. Additionally I received a deliverable group presentation project based on a ‘reconnaissance tool’, a term which before this week I had no idea about, in a cybersecurity context. As such our group was suggested to use gobuster as our reconnaissance tool, and through studying the github documentation of gobuster, I was surprised how many flags could be implemented to get desired output depending on what mode used.

One important concept I learnt through the gobuster documentation was what a wordlist was, as to use gobsuter a wordlist had to specified to brute force against the specified target URL.  

Another issue I had was that I didn’t know what website to use gobuster against and reading the ethical hacking disclaimer from the presentation slides I choose instead of using it against a website to go and watch youtube demonstrations on how the tool is implemented. From these videos and also using the documentation online I was able to understand both how the tool works and also understand the information gathering stage in the pentesting methodology.

Down below is an image of one the youtube videos I used to help me fully understand how gobuster is implemented.

## *SLO 3)*

> ### Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.

Throughout this week we were given the opportunity to go through wargames, I choose to go and do Bandit as the linux commands I know are basic and I haven't had much experience with Linux to where I feel comfortable. The first few levels were all simple and weren't very difficult as I had used all the commands before, progressing through the levels I hadn't used some commands, such as; file, find, uniq and strings. The manual pages were very helpful in allowing me to understand how these commands work, and moreover youtube videos also helped to assist me in understanding how these commands work through demonstrated examples. To pass each level you would have to uncover the password, and I chose to store every password in a text file, and additionally included a little hint of how I completed the level. This can be seen in the image below;

# *SLO 4)*

> ### Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

As discussed above, this week included a deliverable group presentation about a reconnaissance tool of the groups choice we selected gobsuter as suggested by one of the studio mentors. We choose to use Microsoft Teams to communicate to each other as a group so we created a new channel consisting of all four group members,

As displayed above this allowed us to communicate with each other through messages and moreover allowed us to add our own files and edit files simultaneously. Moreover we compiled a wiki where we put all relevant links to what documentation and videos were useful to understanding how gobuster works.

As a group we presented on Thursday, we all agreed to meet earlier to practice, we were also given time to practice during class. I haven't had much public speaking experience during university and I felt as if I kept moving and fidgeting, I accompany this to not knowing my speech very well. I also felt as if I had rushed the content I was presenting due to time restricts and in hindsight should have reduced the amount of content in my speech.  


*****************
# *SLO 5)*

> ### Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation.

I felt as if this week was a strenuous week but also just as rewarding. Though my lack of knowledge was exposed with some concepts such as not understanding what a reconnaissance tool was to not understanding what a wordlist was but through determination and research I was able to understand these concepts alike much better, and not struggle too much.

Personally I’ve completed all of my deliverables needed for the studio, and completed up to level 12 in bandit during my personal time and have made some progression with NATAS reaching level 5. Though I haven't progressed well in other content that I have also wanted to complete, such as watching some professor messer tutorials on CompTIA Security +, I attribute this to a lack of good time management to also fit in other content that will be necessary for me in the coming week due to my low knowledge within cybersecurity. To my peers acknowledgment many times when I didn't understand some concepts they are always there to help me understand and have been very helpful throughout this whole studio.  

My group this week was great we each completed all the content that was expected of us on time and more so equally divided the workload that needed to be complete. When it came to presenting we unfortunately didn’t finish in the time frame of 4 minutes this could be attributed to our lack of practice with the acknowledgement of country slide and did not consider the slide till we were reminded of it on the day.  

To conclude for next week I would like to add more time to do additional study with the Security+ course so that I can have more knowledge on content, and additionally progress much further in bandit and NATAS and possibly make a start on PicoCTF.
